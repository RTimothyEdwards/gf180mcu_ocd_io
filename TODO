Remaining work:
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Validate the 4LM and 3LM layouts.

2. The 3LM layouts have the known issue that the metal3 is not
compatible with the thick top metal option, which is specified
in the gf180mcuA PDK variant.

3. Rework the digital cell liberty file data.  The existing data
are for the original cells, which have 5V core-facing transistors.
The new cells have 3.3V core-facing transistors, and level shifters
between the two voltage domains.

4. The liberty files should specify the value of both voltage domains
in the filename.

5. The corner cell fails LVS because the extraction shows a short
between the two ground domains.  This is not a major issue since
the ground domains are shorted through the substrate, but it needs
to be solved for the corner cell to be able to be used in a top
level cell and have it pass LVS.

6. The low-voltage domain clamp should be reworked for the lower
voltage.

7. The voltage busses should be redistributed, with more busses
changed to the low voltage (VDD, VSS) domain.
